
PYTHON FUNCTIONALITIES AND DATA STRUCTURES IN THE FREAKING C++  
==============================================================

quick description:
    # in this project some great features for C++ are developed for example
    # the internal functionalities of python are very beautiful constructed 
    # in C++ for the powerfulness and simplity that Python programming language
    # comes with and ofcourse if can build them, why not take the chance of 
    # creating a beautiful set of data structures, aglorithms and functionalities
    # that can be very easly used in C++ while programming advanced projects


last update:
    - we created class Object and many other classes that inherit Object for example:
        List, Exception, Int, Float, Char, String ... and many more
    - we actually managed to create a List data structure that contains any available 
        data type and also a List itself
    
things for the next update:
    - more copy constructors for every class
    - more overloaded operators for every class
    - more append_back and append_front functions for List
    - more classes that inherit Object
